Functionality Added:
---  Zombies can now appear on map
---  Added zombie movement
---  Added the ability to pick up weapons
---  zombies drop items
---  zombies take damage
---  items are left on map
Issues: 
---  If Items are on the map, zombies stop being generated after they are all killed until all items are picked up. 
--- When item is picked up image behind player does not change.
---  Bullets change to the projectile type of the newly picked up weapon 
---  All classes could probably use some cleaning up. 
---  We need to also check efficiency make sure everything we do is almost the best way of doing things.
Note::  We should all look into how we should thread this, should improve frame rates a great deal.
